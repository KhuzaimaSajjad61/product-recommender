# Product Recommendation System
Product Recommendation System is an intelligent AI-based application designed to provide personalized product suggestions based on user behavior, preferences, and past interactions. Powered by machine learning models, this system delivers accurate, real-time recommendations to enhance the user shopping experience.

## 🔍 Features
Personalized Recommendations: Uses user ratings, preferences, and historical interactions to suggest relevant products.

Dual Recommendation Engines:

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends similar products based on features like category, price, and brand.

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests products using matrix factorization (SVD) based on what similar users liked.

```
## 🖥️ Installation & Running
### 🔧 Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/KhuzaimaSajjad61/product-recommender.git
cd product-recommendation-system
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t product-recommendor .
```
4. Run the Docker container:
if you want to run the basic version:

```bash
docker run -it --rm product-recommendor
```
if you want to run the advanced version:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -e VERSION=advanced product-recommender
```

## 📊 How It Works
The Product Recommendation System leverages two core machine learning approaches:

### 🧠 Content-Based Filtering
• Analyzes product features like name, category, price, and description.
• Computes cosine similarity between products.
• Suggests similar items to what the user views or selects.

### 🤝 Collaborative Filtering (SVD)
• Uses user-item interactions (ratings matrix).
• Applies matrix factorization to uncover latent user preferences.
• Recommends products based on the behavior of similar users.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
Python:	Core backend and ML processing
Scikit-learn: For content-based filtering and preprocessing
Surprise: Collaborative filtering via SVD
Docker: Containerized deployment
